# Student-Database-using-MYSQL-and-PHP
I created a student database website using MYSQL and PHP as an assignment by my college for recruitment of Web Conveners.

I have used Bootstrap and Xammp while making this.

connect.php : This file contains the script for connecting to the server.
op.php : It is the main page where we'll see the details of the students
edit.php : It has script for editing a record
datab.php : This page contains a form for add a new entry.
delete.php : This page contains the script for deleting a particular entry in the form.
